# K-MeansFromScratch
Implement the k-means algorithm and use it to reduce the color information in a colored
image. You need to divide the colors in an image into two clusters. Once the final means
have been calculated, replace each color with its representative mean value.
You need to document the results for K=2, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20. Comment on the results.
